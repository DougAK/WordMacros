# WordMacros
These are my Word macros. They help me get stuff done at work. They've also helped me learn VBS.
I often think I should share these with colleagues, but I can't imagine getting the help desk to help other people install my macros in their copies of Word.

To install:  In Word 2013 or later, go to Macros, View Macros, Edit. That opens a window "Microsoft Visual Basic for Applications."
You can just scroll to the bottom of whatever code is there (in the right pane) and paste in this additional code.
